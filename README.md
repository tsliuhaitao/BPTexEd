BPTexEd Readme
==============

BPTexEd is a text editor written in BlitzPlus for Windows. That's all there is
to it.

...

Okay, here's some more information.

Requirements
------------

Since BlitzPlus is a Windows-only program you'll need a good copy of Windows.
Go figure.

You'll also need BlitzPlus, which you can get here:
`http://www.blitzbasic.com/Products/blitzplus.php`.
I don't know if you can compile this with the demo.

Compiling
---------

So how do you compile the darn thing? Simple! First, open `bptexed.bb` with the
BlitzPlus IDE. Then, on the menu bar. click _Program_ and choose whatever
option your little heart desires.

On command-line the following can be accomplished (assuming blitzcc is in your
path) with:

```
blitzcc -c -o bptexed.exe bptexed.bb
```

This will generate `bptexed.exe` which you can then run.

Coding Style
------------

There's enough code here for you to figure that out. BlitzBasic isn't that
complicated.
